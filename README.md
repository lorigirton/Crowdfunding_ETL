## Description
For this project, we leveraged the Pandas Python library within a Jupyter Notebook environment to construct four distinct dataframes sourced from two separate Excel files. Each dataframe was transformed into a CSV file, ensuring data integrity and consistency. Subsequently, we employed QuickDBD to design a comprehensive database schema and integrated into a Postgres SQL.
